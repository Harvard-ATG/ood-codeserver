# Code Server app user-facing configuration form file (generic sub-app)
# This config file is both an actual configuration file for an actual sample 
# application, and a starting point for configuring a new sub-app. To make a 
# custom application launch for a course, make a copy of this file in the same
# folder and customize the form config to your liking. There are notes along
# the way to help you understand what options you can make configurable to users.
# See the docs page from Open OnDemand for more details:
# https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/develop/how-tos/app-development/interactive/form.html
